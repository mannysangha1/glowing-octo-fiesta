FIRST I CLEANED UP THE CODE BY PUTTING THE PARAGRAPHS TOGETHER

THEN I SPACED OUT THE DIFFERENT SECTIONS (IMAGES, HEADERS, BOXES)

THEN I CHANGED THE IMAGE TITLES TO BE MORE DESCRIPTIVE. I ALSO CHANGED THE WEBSITE TITLE.
-BRAND AWARENESS (LIGHTBULB IN SUIT AND TIE)
-COST MANAGEMENT (GEAR WITH DOLLAR SIGN)
-DIGITAL MARKETING MEETING (STOCK PHOTO OF COLLEGE STUDENTS DISCUSSING THINGS)
-LEAD GENERATION (GEAR INTO FUNNEL TURING INTO DOLLAR SIGN)
-ONLINE REPUTATION MANAGEMENT (IMAGE OF UNSEEN PERSON HOLDING A PHONE AND USING A MACBOOK WITH A REPUTATION GRAPH ON THE SCREEN)
-SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (IMAGE WITH LAPTOP KEYBOARD WITH MAGNIFYING GLASS ON SAID KEYBOARD, NOTEBOOK, CUP OF COFFEE AND PENS IN CUP AND SCATTERED AROUND)
SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING (IMAGE WITH WORDS LIKE, TWEET, SHARE AND MEDIA; VARIOUS INTERENET AND SOCIAL MEDIA RELATED LOGOS )

FIXED AN ERROR IN THE LINKS; THE SEARCH-ENGINE-OPTIMIZATION LINK WASN'T RESPONDING WHEN YOU CLICKED IT. ADDED A <DIV ID=""> TO FIX IT.

    <div class="search-engine-optimization">
            <img src="./assets/images/search-engine-optimization.jpg" class="float-left" />
            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p> The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility and find the right customers for your business. </p>
                                       CHNAGED TO
    
    <div id="search-engine-optimization" class="search-engine-optimization">
            <img src="./assets/images/search-engine-optimization.jpg" class="float-left" />

WHILE I AM DONE WITH THIS ASSIGMENT, I AM NOT DONE WITH THIS CODE AS I AM LOOKING INTO BIONIC READING AND AM STILL GOING TO TINKER WITH THAT FOR THE FUTURE.
